require 'baby'
require 'rattle' # this is only here to illustrate examples 1 and 2, more below

# A note on terminology. It's not as complicated as it first appears:
# Everytime you've written an `expect(x).to y` statement you've created a mock.
# When you write `allow(x).to receive(y)` you're doing a (partial?) stub
# When you write `allow(x).to receive(y).and_return(z)`, that's a stub
# All of the above can be applied to real objects, but also fake ones (doubles)
# If you replace `x = Object.new` with `x = double('Object'), you've made a double.
# Use stubs to give it any functionality needed.

# The examples below illustrate these principles and the comments show what's
# going on and whether the test is expected to pass or fail.

# Note: my current understanding is that doubles should not be used for feature
# tests since, by definition, they need to replicate the use of the actual program.
# So a feature test file would be using the actual rattle (as in e.g. 2)
# Your unit tests can go nuts with doubles
